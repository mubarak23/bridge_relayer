# 🌉 Rust Bridge Relayer

**Rust Bridge Relayer** is a high-performance, production-ready service for secure and reliable cross-chain communication. Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for speed and memory safety, it listens to events on a source blockchain and relays validated data to a destination chain.

This project can serve as a backbone for token bridges, NFT cross-minting, message-passing protocols, and custom interoperable dApps.

## ✨ Features

- 🪐 **Cross-chain Event Listening**  
  Listens for smart contract events on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum) in real time using WebSockets.

- 🔐 **Optional Signature Validation**  
  Includes support for relaying messages only when signed by a validator set (via ECDSA, multisig, or custom logic).

- 🚀 **Transaction Relay to Destination Chain**  
  Automatically submits verified payloads to a destination smart contract.

- 💾 **Replay Protection**  
  Uses `sled` or pluggable key-value stores to track processed events and prevent duplicates.

- ⚙️ **Configurable via `.env`**  
  RPC endpoints, contract addresses, keys, and more are configured without touching code.

- 🐳 **Dockerized**  
  Comes with a Dockerfile for easy containerized deployments.
