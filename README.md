# 🌉 Rust Bridge Relayer

**Rust Bridge Relayer** is a high-performance, production-ready service for secure and reliable cross-chain communication. Written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for speed and memory safety, it listens to events on a source blockchain and relays validated data to a destination chain.

This project can serve as a backbone for token bridges, NFT cross-minting, message-passing protocols, and custom interoperable dApps.

## ✨ Features

- 🪐 **Cross-chain Event Listening**  
  Listens for smart contract events on the source chain (e.g., Ethereum) in real time using WebSockets.

- 🔐 **Optional Signature Validation**  
  Includes support for relaying messages only when signed by a validator set (via ECDSA, multisig, or custom logic).

- 🚀 **Transaction Relay to Destination Chain**  
  Automatically submits verified payloads to a destination smart contract.

- 💾 **Replay Protection**  
  Uses `sled` or pluggable key-value stores to track processed events and prevent duplicates.

- ⚙️ **Configurable via `.env`**  
  RPC endpoints, contract addresses, keys, and more are configured without touching code.

- 🐳 **Dockerized**  
  Comes with a Dockerfile for easy containerized deployments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rust-bridge-relayer.git
cd rust-bridge-relayer
cargo build --release
```

### 2. Configure .env

```bash

ETH_WS_URL=wss://mainnet.infura.io/ws/v3/your_project_id
DEST_RPC_URL=https://polygon-rpc.com
PRIVATE_KEY=
BRIDGE_CONTRACT=
DEST_CONTRACT=

```

### 3. Run Localy

```bash
cargo run --release

```

### 4. Or Run with Docker

```bash
docker build -t rust-bridge-relayer .
docker run --rm --env-file .env rust-bridge-relayer

```

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

Bridge ERC-20 tokens between chains.

Relay NFT mint requests from Ethereum to L2.

Enable cross-chain governance voting.

Custom message passing between dApps on different chains.

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

Always validate signatures or use trusted validator logic before relaying.

Ensure replay protection is robust (storage layer must persist between restarts).

Monitor gas usage and rate-limit relays when needed.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

Planned or potential features for future releases:

✅ Multisig Validator Support – Verify that a threshold of validators have signed a payload before relaying.

🕸 Multiple Chain Support – Watch and relay events across multiple networks (Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum, etc.).

📦 Pluggable Storage – Swap out sled for Redis, RocksDB, or Postgres.

📡 Metrics and Monitoring – Prometheus/Grafana integration for relay counts, failures, and latency.

💬 Web Dashboard – Minimal UI for status monitoring, event history, and manual resends.

🧪 Unit + Integration Tests – Strengthen test coverage and add mock chain simulators.

⛓ ZKP-based Validation Support – Integrate with zkBridge protocols for provable payloads.

🔄 Bidirectional Relaying – Allow bidirectional relays between two chains.

📑 Config File Support – Support .toml/.yaml configuration in addition to .env.
